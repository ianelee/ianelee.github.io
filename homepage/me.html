        <p id="mountaintext"> My name is Ian Lee! I am a 17 yo who's currently in his senior year of highschool. This webpage is about my mountain climbing trip. The mountain I scaled is the Algonquin Peak in the Adirondack Mountains! It is the second highest mountain peak and is in the MacIntyre Range.</p>
        <p id="mountaintext"> At the start of the hike, I slipped in some mud. It got my hands and pants dirty, which kind of sucked. However, I later fell in a creek which washed it all off! It also got my boots and socks all wet which became a major issue later.</p>
        <p id="mountaintext"> The hike was beautiful! Some people even brought their dogs, although I didn't get pictures of them. Eventually you pass this point where you have to have spikes on your shoes because the floor is all snow and ice. When you stepped on rocks it sounded horrendous, but it made it so I wouldn't slip and fall on the ice! The snow covered eveything and it made it seem like you were in the middle of a Christmas movie, but in actuality it was the middle of October.</p>
        <p id="mountaintext"> Eventually we passed the point where plants stopped growing, but there were these cool ice plants that we couldn't touch since they were very fragile. The temperature kept dropping and my feet were freezing since they were still soaked, so I put some heat packers in my boots but they didn't do much. My upper body was sweating and it was almost as if my body was confused on what temperature it should be!</p>
        <p id="mountaintext"> When I got to the top it felt amazing! However, getting down was a pain in the ***. My knees felt like they would collapse by the end of it, and I was just happy to be able to eat anything besides hiking snacks afterwards! Besides that it was an amazing experience, which I would highly reccomend.</p>
